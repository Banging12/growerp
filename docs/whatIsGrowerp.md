# What is open source GrowERP?

GrowERP is an easy understandable system to solve the problem of normally smaller companies starting with ERP. These
starters select some of the smaller ERP systems and find out after some time that either the functionality
is limited or that it cannot be easily adapted to specific business requirements.

GrowERP is a number of components on top of a full enterprise size backend system. The GrowERP
system provides the minimal functions required to run the administration of a company for
customers and suppliers, products, sales and purchase orders and automatic full ledger accounting.
From a data point of view the system is completely compatible with the full
backend version which can operate without the GrowERP frontend.

Because the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework is used, GrowERP can be installed on most platforms natively
i.e. can compete with other applications on that platform compared to speed, interfaces and integration.

Functions from the full backend version can be relatively easily added to the frontend because
just the interface and screens are required.

The system can operate in single or multiple company mode when a single instance of the system can support multiple companies which are complete separated
